Academy whose aim is to promote give basic technics to talented African youths.
Since joining Italanta, I have acquired basic skills the qualify me to be a
Software developer. My primary goal after completion of this course is to work
for one of two sponsors sponsoring this project, _**elewa**_ and _**Microsoft
ADC**_. To get where I want to be, I must apply myself throughout this course
